## Module 4 Challenge - PyCity Schools
### Analysis
•	Schools with a lower budget had the highest testing averages, and overall passing rate. If you look at the spending summary data frame the schools with the lower per student spending range outperformed both schools in the mid-range and high range per student budget. This may come as a surprise as most would assume that schools with a higher budget would have more student and teacher resources available, therefore producing higher testing scores and overall passing rates.

•	Average test scores stay consistent per school across all 4 years (9th-12th) as seen in the reading and math scores by grade data frame. Additionally, average reading and math testing scores are similar per school despite being different subjects. This may be assumed to be attributed to the school specific curriculum and teachers.

•	Looking at the size summary data frame you will see that schools with a larger student population have considerably lower average testing scores. It is possible that schools with a larger student classroom number may prevent students from receiving individual help when necessary or may create a higher chance of distractions in the classroom.

•	Based on the top 5 schools and bottom 5 schools data frame it is shown that the top 5 schools are Charter schools, while the bottom 5 schools are district schools. District schools have a greater school population in general than charter schools, and charter schools generally have a higher budget than district schools. As seen above schools with a smaller population and budget outperform those with a higher population and budget.
